#1. Add a “Logout” or “Sign Out” Function
- Description: Enable a logged-in user to explicitly terminate their session, remove any cached credentials, and return to the public home screen without restarting the app.
- Location: In “Personal Center” screen under Account Settings, or in any user-menu that appears after login.
- Behavior:
  • Clear locally stored auth token and user data on tap.
  • Redirect to Home/Welcome screen immediately.
  • Disable all protected screens/features until next login.
  • Show confirmation dialog if unsaved changes exist.
  • Invalidate local data even if offline; sync server-side later.
  • Prevent “Back” navigation from restoring old session.
- Edge Cases:
  • If token already expired, still clear local data and redirect.
  • Offline: logout clears local data; any server call is queued.

#2. Allow Unauthenticated Users to Browse Core App Content
- Description: Permit anyone (without signing in) to view Home feed, Search, Category lists, and other primary content. Only protected actions (favorites, comments) require login.
- Location: All “public” tabs (Home, Search, Categories); before any action that requires a user account.
- Behavior:
  • Load content feeds/images exactly as for signed-in users.
  • Show “Login / Sign Up” button in place of user avatar.
  • Buttons requiring login (Save, Comment, Follow) should be visible but disabled or trigger a “Please log in” prompt.
  • Allow seamless scrolling, caching, and offline browsing of public content.
- Edge Cases:
  • Attempting a protected action shows a login modal.
  • Offline browsing uses cache; protected actions queue for later.

#3. Add a “Privacy Policy” (User Agreement) Section Inside Personal Center
- Description: Provide a direct link to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service inside Personal Center so users can read/update consent.
- Location: Under “Settings” or “Account Info” in “Personal Center” tab. Call it “Privacy Policy & Terms of Service.”
- Behavior:
  • Opens a full-screen webview or local HTML/PDF with scrollable text of policy.
  • Displays “Last Updated” date at top.
  • Includes a “Back / Close” button to return.
  • If legal requirements mandate, block sign-up/protected actions until user taps “Agree.”
- Edge Cases:
  • Offline fallback to local copy if using hosted URL.
  • Responsive layout for all screen sizes.
  • On future policy updates, bump “Last Updated” date and re-prompt consent if needed.
  • Track analytics for “View Privacy Policy” taps.
