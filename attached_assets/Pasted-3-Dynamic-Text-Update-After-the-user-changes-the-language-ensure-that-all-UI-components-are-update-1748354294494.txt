3. Dynamic Text Update
After the user changes the language, ensure that all UI components are updated dynamically without requiring the user to reload the page. This means the app should use a method like setState in React or equivalent in your framework to trigger a re-render with the new language values.

4. Images and Icons
If your app contains images or icons that have text embedded in them (e.g., buttons or labels), ensure that the correct images are displayed based on the selected language. Alternatively, you could use SVGs or other scalable images that can dynamically change based on language.

Example: You may have a "Welcome" image with English text that needs to be replaced with Chinese text upon language change.

5. Error Messages and Alerts
Similarly to UI elements, error messages, success messages, and any user notifications should also be translated based on the selected language.

6. Date/Time Formats
If your app displays dates, times, or numbers (especially in milestone tracking), ensure that these formats adjust to regional conventions based on the language selected (e.g., using Chinese-style date formats "年/月/日" versus English "MM/DD/YYYY").

7. Language Files
Organize the translations in separate files for better maintainability. For example:

en.json (English)

zh.json (Chinese)

These files can be loaded dynamically when the language is changed.

8. Context-Sensitive Translations
Be mindful of text that may change meaning depending on the context. Ensure that context-sensitive translation is done properly (for example, the word "Join" in "Join Community" may not always translate the same way in all contexts).

9. Testing
After implementing the changes, thoroughly test both language versions to ensure that no content is mixed and everything displays properly in each language. This includes checking that:

Texts fit properly in buttons and labels without truncation.

Functional components like forms, buttons, and navigation still work seamlessly across language switches.

10. Fallback Mechanism
Implement a fallback mechanism where if a translation is missing for a particular language, it defaults to English or another predefined language.
