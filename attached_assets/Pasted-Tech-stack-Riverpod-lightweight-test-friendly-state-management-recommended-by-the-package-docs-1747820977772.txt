Core screens & flows

Home
	•	Dark purple, star‑field background.
	•	Live Streak Counter updates every second via Timer.periodic; shows “X days” or “H hr M m” plus a sub‑row of remaining time.
	•	Weekly status bar renders ✓, ✕ or – for the last seven days by inspecting user daily logs.
	•	Brain‑Rewiring bar = min(streakDays / 90, 1) × 100 % and refreshes whenever the streak changes.
	•	Four Quick Action buttons: Pledge ✋, Meditate 🧘, Reset ↻, More ⋯.
	•	Panic Button swaps to a full‑screen overlay that flashes red/white text and triggers continuous vibration—exactly the dramatic UX reported in Ed Latimore’s review.  ￼  Long‑press (≈3 s) exits.

Daily Check‑In (three‑step modal)
	1.	Relapse? Blue “No 💪” vs. red “Yes ⚠️”; also shows “N are still going strong” from stats/{date}.
	2.	Mood pick – 🙂 / 😐 / 😔.
	3.	Community encouragement – displays aggregated mood counts and offers a Reflect journal or Finish button.
Each check‑in writes users/{uid}/dailyLogs/{yyyy‑MM‑dd} and atomically increments the global counters with FieldValue.increment.  ￼

Analytics
	•	Circular Recovery ring shows percentage and current streak day count.
	•	“On track to quit by ” where <date> = lastRelapse + 90 days.
	•	Line graph of streak history via fl_chart.
	•	Share action exposes text or screenshot of progress.

Achievements
	•	Twenty milestone badges (1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 30 … 365 days).
	•	Unlocked badges persist forever based on longestStreak; locked badges show a grey padlock plus a thin progress bar.

Life‑Tree animation
	•	Eight visual stages from Seed to Forest.
	•	Swap images/animations with AnimatedSwitcher whenever the streak crosses a threshold; optional smooth scaling
