INTERVIEWER: What specific aspects of the current user interface do you think are the most confusing or difficult for users to navigate?

RESPONDER: Based on common pain points in habit-tracking apps, these UI elements likely need refinement:

Streak Counter Visibility
Current implementation may bury the streak in secondary screens
Solution: Add prominent home screen widget with glow animation on milestone days
<!-- Homepage header component -->
<div class="bg-indigo-600 rounded-xl p-4 text-center glow-animation">
  <p class="text-white text-sm">Current Streak</p>
  <p class="text-white text-4xl font-bold">{{ currentStreak }} days</p>
</div>
Relapse Logging Flow
Users report difficulty finding the reset button
Suggested change: Dedicated FAB with clear action label
<ion-fab vertical="bottom" horizontal="end" slot="fixed">
  <ion-fab-button color="danger" @click="logRelapse()">
    <ion-icon name="warning"></ion-icon>
    <span class="ml-2">Reset Streak</span>
  </ion-fab-button>
</ion-fab>
Progress Visualization
INTERVIEWER: What specific design elements or features do you think would enhance the visibility of the streak counter on the home screen, apart from the glow animation?

RESPONDER: Here are 3 concrete UI enhancements for the streak counter with code examples:

Dynamic Size Scaling (based on streak length)
// home.page.html
- <div class="text-6xl font-bold">{{currentStreak}}</div>
+ <div class="font-bold" [class]="'text-' + (4 + currentStreak/10) + 'xl'">{{currentStreak}}</div>
Progress Ring Visualization
<ion-progress-bar 
  [value]="currentStreak/maxStreak" 
  class="h-2 rounded-full"
  color="primary">
</ion-progress-bar>
<p class="text-xs mt-1">{{currentStreak}} of {{maxStreak}} days</p>
Milestone Badges (visual indicators)
// home.page.ts
get streakBadge() {
  if(this.currentStreak >= 30) return '🏆';
  if(this.currentStreak >= 7) return '🔥';
  return '✨';
}
Implementation tips:

Add subtle shadow: shadow-lg
Use contrasting background: `bg-ind
INTERVIEWER: What specific types of content do you think would resonate most with users looking for support in their No-Fap journey, such as articles, videos, or community stories?

RESPONDER: Here are the most effective content types for a No-Fap Recovery Tracker app, with implementation suggestions:

Daily Progress Videos (2-3 min)
Implement with Capacitor Camera/Camera-Plugin for user-generated content
Example: ionic cap sync + @capacitor/camera setup
Milestone Celebrations (Community Stories)
Add a Firebase-powered feed component:
<ion-list>
  {stories.map(story => (
    <ion-item>
      <ion-label>{story.daysClean} days</ion-label>
    </ion-item>
  ))}
</ion-list>
Science-Backed Articles
Use Ionic's ion-card with Tailwind prose classes:
<ion-card class="prose prose-sm max-w-none">
  <ion-card-content>Neuroplasticity content...</ion-card-content>
</ion-card>
Relapse Prevention Guides
Create interactive checklists:
<ion-list>
  <ion-item *ngFor="let tip of tips">
    <ion-checkbox slot
