Implementation Plan for Library and Community Pages

Library Page Overview

The Library page serves as a central hub for educational content and progress tracking in the app. It will mirror the Quittr app’s structure, featuring multiple content categories (Articles, Meditate, Learn, Podcast) and a user progress Leaderboard, all styled in the existing dark theme. This page should seamlessly integrate with the current app’s navigation (e.g. accessible via the menu or relevant tab) without affecting other modules. Users should be able to browse each content section, see their progress, and navigate into detailed content. Key elements of the Library page include:
	•	Header and Introduction: At the top, display the page title “Library” in a bold, large font. Optionally include a tagline (as seen in Quittr: “Quit Porn Easily”) below or beside the title for a motivating touch. On the top-right, include a small “VPN” badge or button (as shown in Quittr) – this can be a static element or a link if a VPN feature exists. The header uses the same dark background and white text for consistency.
	•	Content Category Buttons: Below the title, present four large, colorful buttons or cards labeled Articles, Meditate, Learn, and Podcast. These act as navigation entries to the respective content sections. Each button should have a distinct background color matching the Quittr scheme (for example, orange for Articles, purple for Meditate, pink for Learn, blue for Podcast) and a short title text. Make these buttons visually consistent (rounded corners, similar size) and responsive to taps/clicks (with a slight hover or press effect). Tapping a category card navigates the user to that category’s content page (either by pushing a new screen or switching an internal tab view).
	•	Leaderboard Preview: Below the category buttons, include a Leaderboard section highlighting user streak rankings. This section can have a small header (e.g. “Leaderboard” with a chevron or arrow indicating it’s clickable for full view). Display the top few users and their streaks, as well as the current user’s rank and streak. In the Quittr screenshot, for example, the leaderboard shows the top 3 users (🥇 #1 J. with 739,350d, 🥈 #2 “No Nut Final Boss” 739,349d, 🥉 #3 Matthew 1,919d, etc.) and then the logged-in user’s position (“You are #818 – 0 days”). Implement this by querying the database for the global top streaks and the current user’s streak ranking. Format each entry as “Rank. Name – XXXd” (where XXXd is the streak in days). The user’s own entry can be highlighted or listed separately at the bottom of this preview. Ensure this list is scrollable if needed or truncated with a “View All” option. The “Leaderboard >” text or arrow should navigate to a full leaderboard page or modal where more rankings are shown (keeping existing modules in mind if a full leaderboard already exists, otherwise implement similarly).

The Library main page should use a scrollable layout (if content exceeds screen) and maintain padding on edges (consistent with app spacing, e.g. 16px as per design guidelines). All text should be in the app’s standard font (e.g. DM Sans or similar clean font), and colors should match the established theme (white or light text on dark background, vibrant category colors for buttons). This page acts as a menu for educational resources – no heavy logic on load besides fetching user rank and possibly progress summary.

Navigation & State Management (Library)

Implement navigation so that selecting any content category loads the appropriate sub-page. If using a router (in React, for example), define routes for /library/articles, /library/meditate, etc., and push those when the user clicks the buttons. In Flutter or other frameworks, navigate to new screens or use a tabbed view. Ensure Back navigation: On each sub-page, show a back arrow (as in the Quittr UI) in the top-left to return to the Library main page. The current page title should update accordingly (e.g. “Articles”, “Meditate”, etc.). Alternatively, you can implement the category sections as tabs within the Library page (using a TabView or segmented control at top). In that case, the category buttons at the top could function as tabs rather than separate screens. Given the Quittr design uses large cards, the simplest approach is separate screens for clarity, but either is acceptable if consistent. The key is that the user can easily move between categories and back to the main library. The state (e.g. progress percentages, content lists) for each section should load when that section is opened. Use the existing app’s navigation style (likely the menu or bottom nav) to access Library, and ensure leaving/entering Library doesn’t disrupt other pages’ state.

Articles Section (Library > Articles)

Once the user selects Articles from the Library, they should see the Articles content page. This page presents a structured list of article categories, each containing multiple articles, mirroring the Quittr “Articles” section.

Layout and UI for Articles
	•	Header: Display a back arrow (to Library) and the title “Articles” at the top. Include an info icon (ℹ️) on the top-right – tapping this could show a popup with a brief description or instructions about the Articles section (for example, “Read through these educational articles to learn about addiction, health effects, etc.”).
	•	Article Categories: Organize articles into thematic categories, as seen in Quittr. Each category should be presented as a separate section with its title and a progress indicator. From the screenshots, Quittr had categories like “Addiction and Myths”, “Health Effects”, “Quitting Benefits”, and “Recovery Strategies”. Use these or any categories present in the database. For each category:
	•	Display the category title as a subsection header (e.g. Addiction and Myths).
	•	Show a completion percentage for that category (e.g. “0% Complete”) to indicate how many articles in this category the user has read. Calculate this by dividing the number of articles read by total articles in the category for the current user (data from DB). If none read, show 0%. If partially completed, show the integer percentage (e.g. 67% if 2 of 3 articles read). This text can be aligned to the right of the category title line.
	•	List of Articles: Under each category, list the articles as horizontal scrollable cards or as a grid. Quittr shows them as a horizontal row of colored cards numbered 1, 2, 3, etc. Implement each article as a small card or button:
	•	A number indicating its sequence/order in that category.
	•	A short title or subtitle of the article. For example, in Addiction and Myths: “1. The Neuroscience of Porn Addiction — How…”, “2. Debunking Common Myths About Porn Ad…”, “3. Psychological & Environmental …” (titles truncated to fit). Use the actual titles from the database if available. The card background color should correspond to the category’s color theme (e.g. Addiction and Myths might use the same orange shade as the Articles button, Health Effects might use the pink shade, etc., matching the Quittr color coding). Optionally include a subtle icon or graphic on the card (Quittr used simple geometric backgrounds on these cards).
	•	These article cards should be touchable. On tap, navigate to the article detail page where the full content is shown (we must ensure this page exists or implement it – likely the user had article content in the app already, but if not, we should specify creating it).
	•	After listing the articles for one category, proceed to the next category section (e.g. a vertical stack of categories, each with a horizontal list of article items). The user can scroll vertically through categories. Each category’s list can scroll horizontally if there are multiple articles, as in Quittr’s design.
	•	Article Detail Page: For completeness, define what happens when an article is selected. It should open a new page (or modal) showing:
	•	The article title (and possibly category and article number).
	•	The full content of the article (text, images, etc., presumably stored in the database or a static file).
	•	A completion toggle or automatic mark-as-read: when the user finishes reading, mark this article as completed in the database (perhaps when they scroll to bottom or manually tap a “Mark as read” button). This will update their progress.
	•	A back arrow to return to the Articles list.
Ensure that after reading and returning, the progress indicators update (if using state management, update the state or refetch progress for that category).

Data Integration for Articles

Connect this UI to the database as follows:
	•	Data structure: Expect a collection/table for articles, with fields like id, category, title, content, orderIndex etc. Also possibly a separate table for article categories (with category name and maybe an associated color or order). If categories are not explicitly in DB, they can be derived from article data (group by category). Another table or field in the user profile tracks completed articles (e.g. a list of article IDs the user has finished, or a separate table UserArticleProgress with entries for each user and article).
	•	Fetching: On opening the Articles section, fetch all article categories and their articles from the DB. You can structure the query to return articles grouped by category, or fetch categories then for each fetch articles.
	•	Progress calculation: For each category, compute the percentage of articles completed by the current user. For example, if category “Addiction and Myths” has 3 articles and the user has marked 0 as read, that’s 0%. Store completion status per article in the DB when the user reads one (e.g. add an entry or flag).
	•	Performance: Cache the data if needed to avoid long load times, but ensure any new completion updates reflect. The UI should perhaps optimistically update the 0% to some other value when the user completes an article, or refresh on returning to the list.
	•	Info icon: If using the info (ℹ️) button, you might store a static info text for the Articles section (or simply hardcode a brief message) – no heavy data needed, just a modal or alert showing usage guidance.

Meditate Section (Library > Meditate)

Selecting Meditate from the Library leads to the meditation content. This section provides a set of audio tracks (guided meditations or calming sounds) for the user. The Quittr app had at least two meditation tracks (“Meditation – Sounds by QUITTR” and “Stop Fapping – Sounds by QUITTR”), each with a dedicated playback screen. We will implement a listing of available tracks and an audio player interface.

Layout and UI for Meditate
	•	Header: Like others, show a back arrow and title “Meditate” at the top. An info icon (ℹ️) on the top-right can be included to explain the purpose of these meditations (e.g. “Use these guided meditations to overcome urges and relax.”).
	•	Tracks List: Display the list of meditation audio tracks. If there are only a couple, a simple vertical list of cards or buttons is fine:
	•	Each list item shows the track name (e.g. “Meditation”, “Stop Fapping”) and possibly a brief description or duration if available (e.g. “5 min guided meditation” or just a subtitle “Sounds by QUITTR” as shown in the player). You may also include a small icon (like a play or music icon) or a thumbnail image if provided (the Quittr screenshots for the player show colored backgrounds rather than specific thumbnails, so a simple colored icon could suffice).
	•	Use a design consistent with other list items in the app: perhaps a dark card with light text and maybe an arrow indicator (>) to show it’s clickable. Keep it padded and separated by some margin.
	•	Audio Player Screen: When a user taps a track, navigate to a player screen for that meditation (full-screen or a new page). This screen should mimic the Quittr meditation player:
	•	A minimal UI with a colored background (each track can have a different theme color; e.g. “Meditation” was purple-themed【1†】, “Stop Fapping” was yellow/orange【7†】).
	•	Top: a back arrow to exit the player, and an info (ℹ️) icon on the top-right (likely to show details or tips on meditation). If the info icon is tapped, show a popup with either instructions for the meditation or benefits of using it.
	•	Center: The track title in large text (e.g. “Meditation” or “Stop Fapping”) and a subtitle “Sounds by QUITTR” just below it. Underneath, a timer showing the playback progress (e.g. 00:01 for 1 second elapsed in the screenshots, presumably counting up as audio plays).
	•	Play/Pause Control: A large circular button in the middle (with a pause icon when playing, or play icon when paused). Tapping this toggles playback. The presence of only a pause icon in the screenshots suggests that when the screen opened, the audio started automatically and showed a pause button to allow stopping. Implement accordingly: start playing the track on load, and allow pausing/playing with this button.
	•	Optionally, at the very bottom, a progress bar showing the track’s progress (Quittr’s screenshot shows a thin line at bottom, which might be iOS home indicator rather than a progress bar – it’s a bit unclear. It might just be the iPhone home bar. If desired, include a progress slider so users can seek within the track).
	•	Completing/Exiting: When the track ends or the user exits (back arrow), they return to the Meditate list. There might not be a “completion” to track here as with articles, but if desired, you could mark a meditation as done or record that the user listened (for stats). The main library or profile could eventually show how many meditations done, but that’s extra – not explicitly required. The key is the playback functionality.

Data and Audio Integration for Meditate
	•	Track data: The details for meditation tracks (title, description, audio file URL/path, theme color) can be stored in the database or as a static list in the app. Since the user said the database exists, it might contain references to these audio files. For example, a Meditations table with fields: id, title, audioUrl, color, description.
	•	Audio files: Ensure the audio files are accessible. They might be hosted (e.g. on a cloud storage or bundled in the app). The Replit app should have a way to stream or download these. If using web technology, an HTML5 <audio> element or a JavaScript audio player library can be used to play the track from a URL. If Flutter, use an audio plugin to play local or network audio. Make sure to handle play/pause and maybe buffering states (show a loading indicator if needed when starting playback).
	•	Playback state: Keep track of whether a track is playing or paused. Possibly only one track plays at a time (which is fine). If the user leaves the screen, consider stopping the audio unless background play is intended (likely not needed here).
	•	Info icon content: If provided, you might have a short text for each track (e.g. what this meditation is for). This could be a field in the DB (like infoText), or simply hardcoded strings. Show it in a modal on tap.

Learn Section (Library > Learn)

The Learn section contains a grid of educational videos (likely YouTube or similar) about porn addiction and recovery. In Quittr, this is presented as a series of video thumbnails with an overall completion progress. We will implement a video gallery where users can watch curated videos and track which ones they’ve seen.

Layout and UI for Learn (Video Grid)
	•	Header: Use a back arrow and title “Learn” at the top of the screen (the Quittr screenshot for this section oddly still said “Library”, but we will label it clearly as Learn for consistency). Optionally include an info icon to explain the section (e.g. “Watch these videos to gain knowledge and motivation on your journey.”).
	•	Overall Progress: On the top-right of the header (or on the same line), display the user’s overall video completion percentage, e.g. “0.0%” when none are watched. This percentage = (number of videos watched / total videos) * 100. Format to one decimal place as shown (or whole number if preferred). This gives the user an immediate sense of progress through the video library.
	•	Video Grid: Present the videos in a two-column grid layout with thumbnail images. Each video item in the grid should show:
	•	A thumbnail image or preview frame of the video. (In the screenshots, these are images like a speaker’s image, a cartoon graphic, etc. You might use either static thumbnails stored in the app or embed YouTube thumbnail images via link. If the database contains video entries with thumbnail URLs, use those. Otherwise, consider using placeholder images).
	•	A short title/caption below the thumbnail. E.g. “NoFap Explained”, “The Best NoFap Benefit”, “Escaping Porn Addiction”, “Huberman Explains Porn”, “Relapse Urges: What to do”, “Desexualizing Your Brain”, “Fap Benefits” etc., as shown. Use titles from the DB or a predefined list.
	•	(If a video is loading or unavailable, you could show a placeholder with a loading spinner – in one screenshot “Huberman Explains Porn” had a spinner placeholder, possibly due to network load. But ideally all thumbnails load properly.)
	•	Layout the grid with adequate spacing: perhaps 2 columns, with some padding around images and between rows (8px or 16px gaps). Allow vertical scrolling if there are many videos.
	•	Completion Progress Bar: At the bottom of the list (after all thumbnails), include a “Completion Progress” section. This can be a small panel or just text and a progress bar:
	•	A line of text like “Completion Progress” or “We recommend you watch and understand all of these videos while on your porn-free journey.” (The Quittr app had a sentence to encourage watching all videos). You can use the exact phrasing from Quittr: “We recommend you to watch and understand all of these videos while on your porn-free journey.” below a heading.
	•	A visual progress bar representing the percentage of videos watched. For example, a horizontal bar with a filled portion corresponding to the percentage (blue fill on dark background as seen in Quittr). In the screenshot with 0.0%, the bar was empty (just an outline perhaps). Update this bar as the user watches videos. This is a nice visual indicator in addition to the percentage text.
	•	Video Playback: When a user selects a video from the grid, open a player or link to play it. There are two possible approaches:
	1.	In-App Video Player: If you can embed the video, open a new page or modal with the video player. For YouTube videos, consider using an embedded YouTube player (e.g. an <iframe> if web, or a YouTube player widget if available). For other sources, use an HTML5 video player. Provide controls (play/pause, seek, fullscreen perhaps if on web).
	2.	External/Open Link: Alternatively, simply open the video link in an external browser or YouTube app (less ideal for user experience, but simpler).
In either case, once the user finishes (or if they indicate they watched it), mark that video as watched in the database. If using an in-app player, you could mark as watched when the video finishes (listen for end event). If external, perhaps provide a manual “Mark as watched” button on the video item or in a dialog.
	•	Marking Watched: An optional enhancement is to visually distinguish videos that the user has already watched – e.g. overlay a checkmark on the thumbnail or dim the thumbnail, and count it towards the completion percentage. The Quittr UI didn’t explicitly show checkmarks on thumbnails (from the screenshot alone), but since it tracks progress, likely behind the scenes they know which are done. You can implement a small overlay icon (like an eye or check) or simply rely on the percentage/progress bar.

Data Integration for Learn
	•	Video list data: In the database, have a Videos collection with fields like id, title, thumbnailUrl, videoUrl. The videoUrl could be a YouTube link or direct file link. It should also have an order or some field if a specific order is needed (the UI doesn’t number these, they’re just a collection). Fetch all videos when the Learn section loads.
	•	User progress: Use a UserVideoProgress table or a field in user profile (e.g. an array of watched video IDs). Initially, the user has none watched. Each time a video is completed, update this record. Then compute the percentage = watched count / total count * 100.
	•	Displaying progress: Use the computed percentage to set the text (rounded to one decimal) and the width of the progress bar fill. This should happen on section load and update when a video is marked watched.
	•	Playing videos: If embedding YouTube, ensure you have the correct embed link (YouTube requires a special embed URL format or use their API). If the content is from other sources (like the TED talk “Escaping Porn Addiction” might be on YouTube or TED’s site), plan accordingly.
	•	Error handling: If a video fails to load or play, handle gracefully (show a message like “Video unavailable”). Also consider that some content might require internet; if offline, show an appropriate alert.

Podcast Section (Library > Podcast)

The Podcast section likely contains audio episodes (possibly Quittr’s own podcast or relevant podcast episodes on porn recovery). While we don’t have a screenshot of the Podcast page, we will design it to be consistent with the others.

Layout and UI for Podcast
	•	Header: Back arrow + title “Podcast” at top, and an info icon if needed to describe the section (e.g. “Listen to podcast episodes for advice and stories from the community”).
	•	Episodes List: Display a list of podcast episodes in chronological or specified order. Use a vertical list format:
	•	Each item shows the episode title (e.g. “Episode 1: Title”), and possibly a short description or duration. If a cover image or icon is available for the podcast, include a small thumbnail on the left of the list item.
	•	Also show additional metadata if available, like the date or episode number, or a subtitle “Podcast by Quittr” etc.
	•	Use the same styling as other list items (dark card or divider, with an arrow indicating it’s playable). Ensure touch/click area covers the whole item.
	•	Episode Playback: On tap, navigate to a podcast player screen (which could reuse a similar design to the meditation player since both deal with audio). Alternatively, if simpler, you can integrate a small audio player inline in the list (but a separate screen keeps it consistent).
	•	The podcast player screen would have the episode title, maybe a larger cover image if available, and standard audio controls (play/pause, scrub bar, time elapsed/remaining).
	•	Since meditations already implement an audio player, you can reuse that component: difference might be length (podcasts could be longer) and perhaps showing the episode description on the player screen as well.
	•	Progress Tracking: If desired, track whether an episode was listened to completely, but this is not as critical unless you want to show a completion percentage for podcasts too. (The prompt doesn’t explicitly mention tracking podcast progress, but for consistency you could mark episodes as listened).
	•	If the podcast content is not originally present, consider linking to an external podcast (e.g. if Quittr has a public podcast on Spotify, a link could open it). But assuming the app meant to provide content in-app, embed the audio.

Data Integration for Podcast
	•	Episodes data: In the database, have a PodcastEpisodes collection with fields like id, title, description, audioUrl, duration, maybe releaseDate. Fetch these on opening the Podcast section.
	•	Playback: Use the same audio playing mechanism as Meditate (possibly unify into a single audio player component that can play any provided audio URL). The audioUrl might be an MP3 file hosted somewhere or a stream link. Ensure the player can buffer and play these, and show the time.
	•	User progress: If implementing, track listened episodes similarly to videos (e.g. UserPodcastProgress with listened episode IDs). This could allow showing which episodes are done or partially listened. If not needed, you can skip explicit tracking, simply allow playback.
	•	UI feedback: Possibly highlight a playing episode in the list (if you allow playing without leaving the list), but if using a dedicated screen, not necessary.

Leaderboard Component (Library Page)

The Leaderboard on the Library main page deserves special attention in implementation, as it connects to user data and encourages competition. As described, it should display top users and the current user’s rank:
	•	Design: On the Library page, the leaderboard can be a horizontally scrollable list or a column. Quittr’s design shows it as a vertical list embedded in the page with a heading “Leaderboard >”. We can implement a condensed version:
	•	The heading “Leaderboard” with a right-arrow (or “View All”) is a header row. Make that row clickable to navigate to a dedicated Leaderboard screen (where a full list of ranks can be viewed).
	•	Under that, list say the top 3 users:
	1.	🥇 Username — XYZd
	2.	🥈 Username — XYZd
	3.	🥉 Username — XYZd
Use medal emojis or icons for the top 3 if desired (as Quittr does), or simply use numbering. The streak value should be suffixed with “d” (days). Format the number with commas if very large (though such large numbers may be unrealistic, it’s what the screenshot shows).
	•	Then, if the current user is not in the top 3, show “You are #X – Yd” separately (possibly below the top 3). In Quittr, they showed the user rank in the header line to the right (“You are #818”). You could mimic that by having the heading say “Leaderboard” on left and “You are #818” on right. Either approach is fine. Just ensure the user sees their own position.
	•	Dedicated Screen: If the user taps the Leaderboard section, open a full Leaderboard page (or modal):
	•	This page lists a larger set of users (e.g. top 100 or all, depending on data size). Each entry shows rank, name, and streak. You can reuse a simple ListView here.
	•	Highlight the current user’s entry (maybe with a different background or color) so they can find themselves. Or provide a quick jump to their rank.
	•	A back button to return to Library main.
	•	Data: Pull the leaderboard data from the database. If using Firebase or similar, you might have a Users collection where each user’s streak count is stored. Query this ordered by streak desc, limit 100 (or whatever). Alternatively, maintain a separate Leaderboard record updated by backend. For simplicity, a query at runtime is fine if data size is manageable.
	•	User’s rank: Determining the user’s rank might require knowing how many users have a higher streak. If not readily available from query, you can do: rank = count of users with streak > currentUser.streak + 1. In a SQL database, that’s a COUNT query; in a NoSQL, may need to fetch sorted list or use an index. Since the user said the database is existing, they might already have an endpoint or method for this. Possibly they just store the rank in user profile (but likely not). So implement a small logic to compute or retrieve it.
	•	Live update: The leaderboard need not update in real-time, but if the user’s streak changes (e.g., each day), refreshing the library page should update their rank accordingly. The data can be fetched on page load or pulled periodically.
	•	Styling: Use the same font and color for leaderboard text as elsewhere (white text). The medal emojis can be colored or use icon images. Ensure alignment is neat (maybe use a monospaced section for the numbers or table layout). The background remains the dark theme – possibly you can put the leaderboard on a card with a slightly darker background to distinguish it from the rest of the library page. Quittr’s design simply listed them on the dark background with no card container, which is fine.

Community Page Overview

The Community page connects users through forums and teams, replicating Quittr’s social features. It contains two main tabs: Forum (a message board for user posts/questions) and Teams (small group support or accountability teams). We will implement the Community page with these tabs, a list of posts or teams accordingly, and interactive elements like creating new posts and viewing community rules. The UI should follow the existing style: dark background, white text, and use the bottom navigation’s community icon (chat bubble) for access. We must integrate this with the database for storing posts, replies, team info, and also ensure users accept the community rules before participating.

Tab Navigation (Forum vs Teams)

At the top of the Community screen, include a segmented control or tab buttons to switch between Forum and Teams views:
	•	Use two tabs labeled “Forum” and “Teams”. Style them as pill-shaped buttons or simple text tabs. In Quittr’s UI, the active tab “Forum” was a filled pill (white background, dark text) and the inactive “Teams” was just text (semi-transparent or unselected state). Replicate this: when “Forum” is active, show it with a highlighted style and “Teams” in an inactive style, and vice versa.
	•	The content below should switch based on the selected tab. You can implement this by maintaining a state (e.g. activeTab = 'forum' or 'teams') and conditionally rendering the Forum list or Teams list. The user should be able to tap the other tab to switch instantly.

Additionally, on the Forum tab, a sort/filter control is visible in Quittr: the screenshot shows a “New ▼” dropdown on the right side. This likely allows sorting posts by “New” or “Top” etc. Implement a simple dropdown or toggle for sorting:
	•	Default can be “New” (latest posts first). The dropdown might include options like “Top (most upvoted)” or “My Teams” (if applicable). If implementing sorting, ensure it triggers a re-fetch or sort of the posts list.
	•	If not enough time, you can hardcode “New” for now but leave the UI element for future extension.

Forum Tab: Posts List

When the Forum tab is active, display a scrollable list of forum posts (threads) created by users. Each post should be shown as a card with key information, similar to the Quittr design:
	•	Post Card Layout: Each forum post in the list can be a clickable card or container with a slightly raised or shaded background (e.g. a dark navy rectangle on the black background, to distinguish it).
	•	Title/Content Preview: Show the post’s title or first line in a prominent font. Quittr’s examples: “I need serious help”, “I’m a failure”, “I’m back where I was a year ago”, etc. These appear to be either the full post if it’s short or a user-provided title. In many forums, users provide a title and body; it’s possible Quittr just takes the first part of the body as the title if no separate title field. For implementation, you can treat the entire post text as one field and just display the first sentence or up to X characters as a preview (maybe 1-2 lines).
	•	Snippet/Excerpt: If the post is longer, include a snippet of the content below the title. For example, in “I need serious help”, the card shows a second line “Ah f*** man. Feeling like shit mentally all day then come home from work to beat my sh**…” – which is the beginning of the user’s post content, truncated. Do this only if the post text is multi-line. For shorter posts like “I’m a failure 😟”, they might have no additional content, so just the title is shown (with the emoji). Ensure to properly handle any emojis or special characters in the text.
	•	Metadata (User and Time): Below the title (or snippet), display metadata in a smaller, secondary-text style:
	•	Username of the author (e.g. “Sean”, “Benjamin”, “Skyler Kent”, etc. from screenshots). Precede the name with a small user icon or avatar if available (Quittr shows a generic person icon before the name).
	•	Streak of the author at the time of posting, e.g. “• 0 Day Streak” or “• 6 Day Streak”. This gives context about the user’s progress. Fetch the streak from the user’s data (either store the streak value with the post in DB for consistency, or join from user profile when displaying).
	•	Timestamp of the post, formatted in a relative manner (Quittr uses a relative time like “21分前” which is “21 minutes ago” – likely because the phone’s locale is Japanese/Chinese for time units). You can display as “X minutes ago”, “2 hours ago”, “3 days ago” etc., using a time-ago library or function to convert the post’s timestamp. This should update on refresh but doesn’t need live updating by the second.
	•	Interactions (Votes/Replies): On the right side of each post card, include indicators for community interaction:
	•	Quittr shows an arrow icon with a number (e.g. an upward arrow in a circle alongside “0” or “7”). This likely represents upvotes (or “likes”) on the post, or possibly the number of replies. Given forum convention, an upvote arrow with a count is typical for votes. However, since the number “7” on “I’m a failure” could also mean 7 replies, it’s a bit ambiguous.
	•	Our implementation: We can support both upvotes and replies:
	•	Include an upvote button (an icon like a caret arrow or a thumbs-up). If a user taps it, increment the post’s vote count (and perhaps change the icon color to indicate the user has upvoted, and prevent multiple upvotes by the same user). The count next to it reflects the total upvotes. This encourages users to support or appreciate a post. If implementing upvotes, store each user’s vote in the DB (e.g. a set of user IDs who upvoted or a separate votes table) and the post’s score.
	•	Also consider showing a comment count if the design allows. You could use a speech bubble icon with the number of replies. Quittr did not explicitly show a comment icon on the card, possibly to keep it clean. It might only show the upvote count. If we want reply count visible, we can add it (e.g. to the right of the upvote count, a small chat icon and number). This is optional but can be helpful so users know if a post has responses.
	•	If space is tight or we want to stick close to Quittr’s look: just show one icon+number. We might interpret that arrow+number as the reply count with a collapse/expand indicator. However, an upward arrow usually implies an upvote. Quittr might be using it as a vote (especially since “I’m a failure” got 7 upvotes likely).
	•	Decision: Implement it as an upvote for now. So each card will have an up arrow icon and a number showing the total upvotes. The user can tap the arrow to upvote (which will increase the number by 1 and perhaps change the icon to solid). If a user has already upvoted, maybe disable or allow removing vote with a second tap.
	•	Card Actions: The entire card should be clickable/tappable to open the full post thread (detailed view). Tapping not on the upvote icon but elsewhere in the card opens the post detail page where the user can read all replies and respond (see “Posting and Replying” below).
	•	List Behavior: The list should be scrollable. Use lazy-loading or pagination if the number of posts is large (you could load, say, 20 most recent posts, with a “Load more” button or infinite scroll as needed). Initially, showing the latest posts (sorted by creation time descending if “New” sort is selected). If “Top” sort is chosen, sort by number of upvotes descending. Implement the sorting toggle such that it reorders the displayed list or triggers a re-fetch from DB with appropriate ordering.
	•	Floating Action Button (New Post): As in the screenshot, show a floating “+” button (circular, with a plus sign) at the bottom center or bottom-right of the screen. This button is used to create a new post. It should be visible on the Forum tab (and possibly on Teams tab too if posting there, but likely primarily for forum threads).
	•	Style this button in the app’s accent color (Quittr uses a white circle with a shadow for the “+”, or could be colored – but white circle stands out on dark background).
	•	On tap, this should navigate to a “New Post” screen or dialog where the user can write their post (discussed later).

Teams Tab: Teams List

When the Teams tab is active, the content should display user teams or group challenges. The Quittr app likely uses “Teams” as a way for users to form small support groups or join team-based challenges. We’ll implement a structure for Teams:
	•	Teams Overview: If the user is not a member of any team or if teams require joining, consider showing an introductory message like “Join a team to stay accountable with others!” and a button to find or create teams.
	•	Team List: If the user is in one or more teams, list them here. If not, list available teams or suggestions. Each team can be displayed as a card or list item, possibly similar to posts but with different info:
	•	Team Name: The name of the team (e.g. “Team Alpha”, “NoFap Warriors”, etc.).
	•	Team Description or Goal: A short tagline for the team, or the goal of that team (if provided, e.g. “5 people aiming for 90 days” or “Regional support group”).
	•	Member Count: Show how many members are in the team, e.g. “🌐 10 members” or an icon of people with number.
	•	Team Streak/Status: If teams compete or track a collective streak, you might show something like “Team streak: X days” or “Active since …”. (If the concept exists – not sure from UI, but something to consider if data available).
	•	Possibly an icon or avatar cluster to represent team. Or just a simple card with text.
	•	If the user is not yet in a team, you might show a list of popular teams they can join. In that case, each item could have a “Join” button on it. Tapping join could instantly add the user to that team (update DB), or if teams require approval, send a request. For simplicity, we can allow free joining.
	•	If the user is already in some teams, list those first, then perhaps an option to browse more teams.
	•	Team Detail/Posts: This part is a bit unclear from the prompt and screenshots (no direct image of team content). Possibly, each team might have its own mini-forum or chat. If so, tapping a team could open a page similar to the Forum but filtered to that team’s members/posts. For now, we can assume teams have a discussion board. So:
	•	When a team is tapped, navigate to a Team Detail page, which could show the team’s info (name, description, members list) and any posts/messages within that team. This would function like a private forum just for that team.
	•	In that page, you could reuse the forum post component for messages, and allow posting within the team. Team posts might not need upvotes (or maybe they do, but likely just support).
	•	Ensure a back button to return to the Teams list.
	•	If implementing team posts is too complex for now, an alternative: when tapping a team, simply show a popup with basic info and say “Feature coming soon” or direct them to an external group chat if one exists (some apps use Telegram groups for teams). However, since the prompt expects replication, it’s better to implement at least a basic version of team discussion.
	•	Creating a Team: Possibly the floating “+” button when on Teams tab could be used to create a new team. If the user taps + while on Teams, present a form to enter a team name, description, etc., and then save it to DB and auto-join the user to that team. This would allow community growth. If you implement this, also ensure the new team appears in the list after creation. If you want to restrict team creation, the + could either be hidden on Teams tab or repurposed. Clarify this:
	•	One approach: When + is tapped, check the active tab. If Forum, open New Post dialog. If Teams, open New Team dialog.
	•	Alternatively, have a separate UI element for creating teams (like a small “Create Team” button in the Teams list if no teams, or in a menu).
	•	In absence of explicit instruction from Quittr screenshots, we can allow team creation via the + to give full functionality.

Community Post Detail and Replies

When a user taps a post on the Forum (or a team’s post), open the Post Detail page to show the full conversation:
	•	Post Content: At the top, show the original post’s content in full. This includes the title (if you treat it separately) and the body text, as well as the metadata (author, streak, timestamp). Use a similar card or just text on the dark background with slight separation.
	•	Replies List: Below the original post, display all replies/comments in chronological order (oldest first, or maybe newest first if that’s the design – but usually oldest first in forums). Each reply should show:
	•	The reply text.
	•	The author name, streak, and timestamp (just like posts).
	•	Possibly a smaller indent or a slightly different background to distinguish replies from the original post.
	•	If the forum supports nested replies (replies to replies), you might need to indent further. This can get complicated; it might be enough to have only one level (all replies directly to the main post).
	•	You can also allow upvoting on replies (though Quittr didn’t indicate that; not necessary unless you want consistency).
	•	Reply Input: At the bottom of the post detail screen, provide a text input and send button for the user to add a reply. Something like a small text field with placeholder “Write a reply…” and a send icon (paper plane or arrow). When the user submits, save the reply to the database (with reference to the post ID, the user, timestamp) and refresh the reply list. Ideally, the new reply appears in the list immediately (optimistically or after confirmation from DB). Also consider clearing the input field and possibly scrolling to the new reply.
	•	Interactions: If upvoting is enabled on posts in the list, also reflect it here – e.g., the post detail could show a larger upvote button or just reuse the small one with count. If the user hasn’t upvoted yet, allow it here as well. Same logic – update count and DB.

Ensure that only logged-in users can write posts or replies. (The app presumably requires login anyway for tracking progress, etc.) If a user somehow isn’t logged in, prompt them to login when trying to post.

Community Rules Popup

The first time a user accesses the Community, they should see a Community Rules modal, as shown in Quittr. This is to ensure a respectful environment. Implement this as follows:
	•	Triggering the Rules: Check if the user has accepted the community rules. This can be tracked via a boolean flag in the database user profile (e.g. acceptedCommunityRules: true/false) or local storage. Initially, for new users, it’s false.
	•	When the user navigates to the Community page (or specifically tries to view Forum/Teams content), if the flag is false, show the Rules modal. This should overlay the Community page (dimming the background).
	•	Rules Content: The modal should have a title “Community Rules” and a list of rules, exactly or closely matching Quittr’s 13 rules:
	1.	Don’t post porn or sexual media.
	2.	Don’t post discriminatory material or hate speech.
	3.	Don’t attempt to use QUITTR as a replacement for therapy/treatment/mental healthcare.
	4.	Don’t advertise, self-promote, or otherwise market anything.
	5.	Stay on-topic. Posts must be about sexual self-improvement (porn addiction/CSBD recovery).
	6.	Don’t collect personal information from the community.
	7.	Don’t disrupt other places.
	8.	Don’t moralize or disparage people’s sexual health choices. (This is not an anti-masturbation forum.)
	9.	Don’t stir up drama.
	10.	Avoid politics.
	11.	Avoid spreading misinformation.
	12.	Don’t engage in piracy/copyright/trademark infringement.
	13.	Stay positive and encourage others. Don’t discourage or disparage people.
(These are the rules from the screenshot 【8†】 – include them verbatim for clarity.)
	•	Style the rules as a numbered list in a scrollable area (since on a small screen it might overflow). Use white text on a slightly lighter overlay background (the Quittr modal had a purple-toned background separate from the main background). You can use a semi-transparent panel or a card with a slight border-radius to make it look like a modal sheet.
	•	Join/Accept Button: At the bottom of the rules, provide a prominent button labeled “Join Community” (white text on a colored background, or white background with dark text as in Quittr). This button signifies acceptance of the rules. When tapped:
	•	Set the acceptedCommunityRules flag to true (in DB or local storage).
	•	Dismiss the rules modal so the user can see the forum content.
	•	Optionally, you might also officially add the user to the community member list (if there is such a concept, e.g., increment a community members count or log the acceptance).
	•	Close/X: Also allow the user to close the modal via an “X” button at top-left in case they change their mind. If they close without accepting, you could treat it as not accepted; maybe they can still read posts but not create? Or simply require it whenever they come until they accept. Likely, acceptance is needed to post, but reading could be allowed. However, for simplicity, you might not load any content until they accept (Quittr shows the posts behind the modal, implying read access might be there, but posting disabled until join).
	•	Ensure that once accepted, the rules modal does not show again on subsequent visits (unless you want to provide an accessible copy of rules somewhere, perhaps via that document icon on community page).

The document icon in the top-right of the Community page in the screenshot is likely a way to manually view the community rules later. You should implement that as well:
	•	The icon (which looks like a sheet of paper or rules list) when tapped can trigger the same Rules modal for reference. This should be available even after acceptance (just to remind users of rules).
	•	If the user hasn’t accepted yet and they tap that icon, it’s effectively the same outcome (they see the rules; they can then tap Join).

Posting New Threads and Teams

When the user taps the “+” FAB on the Community page:
	•	If Forum tab active: Open a New Post screen/dialog.
	•	This screen should have a simple form: perhaps just a multiline text area for the content of the post. (If you want to separate title and body, you can have a title field and body field. Quittr’s interface appears to treat the first line as title, but it’s not explicitly shown. To be safe, you might include a “Title” input and a “Content” textarea for the post, or simply one combined field.)
	•	If separate title is used, keep it short (maybe 100 char limit) and content can be longer.
	•	Provide a submit button (e.g. “Post” or a paper-plane icon).
	•	On submission: validate that it’s not empty, then create a new post entry in the database with the current timestamp, author = current user (include their username and current streak), content/title as provided, and initialize vote count = 0, reply count = 0.
	•	After saving, close the form and refresh the forum list to include the new post at top (if sorting by New).
	•	Error handling: if DB save fails, show an error message. If success, maybe show a toast “Posted!”.
	•	Consider limiting post frequency or length if needed (to avoid abuse), but that might be outside scope.
	•	If Teams tab active: We have two possible actions for “+”:
	1.	Create New Team: If the user is looking at Teams list and hits +, present a form to create a team (Team name, optional description). Similar to above, save a new team entry in DB with the creator as a member. Then refresh the Teams list to show it.
	2.	Alternatively, the + on Teams could be meant to create a new Team Post if inside a team. But since on the main Teams tab we are not inside a specific team context, it makes more sense that + would create a team itself.
	•	We should implement New Team creation for completeness: A dialog with “Team Name”, “Description” fields. On submit, create the team (generate an ID, save name/desc, set the current user as the team leader perhaps and add them to a team members sub-collection).
	•	After creation, maybe auto-navigate the user into that team’s detail page so they can start posting or inviting others.
	•	In summary, make the FAB context-sensitive based on the active tab:
	•	If forum: new forum thread.
	•	If teams: new team (since there isn’t a notion of generic team post outside of a team).

Data Integration for Community (Forum & Teams)

To support the above functionality, integrate with the database as follows:

Forum Posts:
	•	Use a Posts collection/table. Each post should have fields: id, authorId, authorName, authorStreak, content (or title & body), timestamp, upvoteCount, maybe replyCount. If using a NoSQL like Firebase, a document per post, and replies could be sub-collection or separate Replies collection keyed by postId. If SQL, maybe posts and a separate comments table.
	•	Fetching posts: On loading the forum tab, query the latest posts (for “New” sorting). For example, in Firebase, order by timestamp desc, limit 20. For “Top” sorting, order by upvoteCount or a score field. You may need to perform separate queries if supporting multiple sorts.
	•	Creating post: Write a new document to Posts. If using Firebase, security rules or backend should ensure only authenticated users write, but since this is internal, just ensure the user is logged in. After writing, no immediate need to create a replies subcollection (it will be empty until replies come).
	•	User streak in post: It’s useful to save the author’s streak at time of posting (as authorStreak) so that the post metadata doesn’t change even if the user’s streak changes later. Quittr’s forum likely shows streak at post time, which might or might not update. This is a design choice. If you want to always show current streak even on old posts, you could fetch the user’s current streak each time (join with user data). But that can cause inconsistency or heavy reads. Simpler: store the streak value with the post when created, and just display that. (E.g. Sean had 0 day streak at posting time; if he later has 5 days, the post still says 0 day streak – that’s fine as a historical record.)
	•	Replies: Use a Replies collection, where each reply has id, postId, authorId, authorName, authorStreak, content, timestamp, upvoteCount(optional). Fetch replies for a post when viewing the detail (query by postId). When adding a reply, save with reference to postId. Optionally increment a replyCount field in the parent post (so you can show number of replies if needed).
	•	Upvotes: For upvoting posts (or replies if implemented):
	•	You can maintain an array of userIds who upvoted, or just increment a count. Easiest is to have a upvoteCount and a separate way to know if the current user has voted (to prevent multiple votes). If using Firebase, one pattern is to have a subcollection like PostVotes with documents for each user that voted on that post. But that could be heavy. Alternatively, when user tries to upvote, check if their id is in a voters array on the post (which you maintain).
	•	Simpler for now: increment count blindly and perhaps disable the button in UI once clicked (assuming users won’t try to cheat).
	•	If you want to be thorough, implement the data structure to prevent multi-votes (but this is more backend logic).
	•	Sorting/Filtering: The “New” vs “Top” selection can be handled by queries as mentioned. Also if you wanted a “My Teams” filter to show only posts from user’s teams on forum (if relevant), you’d query posts where author is in user’s team or such. This is speculative; focus on New and Top primarily.
	•	Loading state & errors: Show a loading spinner when fetching posts initially. If it fails, display an error message (e.g. “Failed to load forum, please check connection”). Same for replies in a post detail. This makes the UI robust.

Teams:
	•	Use a Teams collection. Fields: id, name, description, createdBy, createdAt. Possibly a list of member IDs or a subcollection TeamMembers mapping user to team.
	•	Fetching teams: On loading Teams tab, you could fetch two sets: teams the user belongs to, and maybe some recommended or all teams. If a TeamMembers subcollection exists, query it for records where userId == current user to find their teams. Then fetch those team details. Also fetch maybe a list of popular teams (or all teams limited by some number) to show others. Or if user not in any, just show some top teams to join.
	•	Joining team: When user clicks a “Join” on a team card, add a record in TeamMembers linking that user to the team. Also update any member count. Then ideally, that team will show up under user’s teams on next load (you can also immediately reflect it in UI).
	•	Creating team: Insert a new Team in Teams, and add the current user to TeamMembers for that team. Perhaps assign them a role (leader).
	•	Team posts: If implementing team-specific posts (like each team has its own mini forum), you can treat them as regular posts with a teamId field. So a post can either be a general forum post (teamId null) or a team post (teamId set). In the forum list, you’d normally exclude team-specific posts (unless you have a separate view for them). On a Team detail page, you’d filter posts where teamId == that team. This way you reuse the posting and reply logic.
	•	If not implementing team posts, you could omit this and just keep teams as a directory of groups possibly with an external chat link. But for completeness, the above method is a good approach.
	•	Member info: On a team card, if you want to show member count or a list of members, you can maintain a memberCount in Teams that increments/decrements on join/leave. Or always count the TeamMembers entries on the fly (less efficient). Possibly update memberCount when someone joins (easy to do transactionally).
	•	Security: Ensure that when a user posts in a team, their post’s teamId is set and maybe verify they belong to that team (if implementing that logic). Similarly, restrict viewing a team’s posts to members if intended (though in an open app like Quittr, teams might be open or public to view, not sure).

User Profile Data:
	•	The user’s streak is crucial in multiple places (post metadata, leaderboard). The streak is likely already computed in the app’s existing logic (perhaps the second bottom-nav icon “progress” tracks days since last relapse, etc.). Ensure that whatever mechanism updates the streak (daily counter or user input on relapse) updates the value in the database that we use for display. If there is a user profile collection, include currentStreakDays and maybe bestStreakDays etc. Use currentStreakDays for leaderboard and forum display.
	•	The username should be stored for each user (perhaps they set it on sign-up or it could be part of their email). If the app lacks username, consider using part of email or an anonymous name. However, since Quittr shows proper names, assume there is a username field.
	•	The community features should use these profile fields. When creating a post or reply, attach authorName and authorStreak as mentioned.
	•	If a user changes their name or if the streak increases next day, the posts they already made likely remain with old data (as noted). That’s fine.

Connecting to Existing DB:
Since the user says an existing database is confirmed, ensure all new data structures (posts, teams, etc.) are created in that DB. If it’s a relational DB, you might need to define new tables (e.g. posts, replies, teams, team_members). If it’s a NoSQL (like Firebase), define new collections accordingly. Work with what the current app already uses (they might already have some of these if they started implementing).
	•	Before coding, check if any partial implementations exist (maybe a posts collection or some UI placeholders). Make use of those to maintain consistency.
	•	For tracking Library progress in DB: likely user profile has fields or subcollections for completed content. If not, you can add:
	•	completedArticles: [articleId...]
	•	watchedVideos: [videoId...]
	•	listenedPodcasts: [episodeId...]
These can be arrays of IDs or separate mapping tables. Use these to calculate progress as described. If using a relational DB, a join table like user_article_status could mark completions.

UI Styling and Theming

To maintain consistency with the rest of the app and the Quittr design, adhere to the established styling rules:
	•	Color Scheme: Use the dark mode palette throughout. The background should be a deep navy or black (#0B0E11 or similar). Cards and list items can use a slightly lighter dark shade (#16202A for example) for contrast. Text is primarily white or light gray for secondary text. The category buttons in Library and other accent elements use vibrant colors (orange, purple, pink, blue, etc.) – match these exactly if possible (you can eyedrop from the screenshots). For example, the Articles button and cards are a warm orange (#D98025 approximation), Meditate purple (#6B4ED6), Learn pinkish (#D162AC), Podcast blue (#429BF5). These colors were also used in the article category cards and progress visuals. Reuse them to tie the sections together.
	•	Typography: The app uses a clean sans-serif font (likely DM Sans as noted in Quittr’s design). Ensure all text uses the same font family. Titles (page headers like “Library”, “Community”) should be bold and around 24-32px (depending on platform units) – clearly stand out. Section headers (like category titles or “Leaderboard”) might be slightly smaller, bold or semi-bold ~18-20px. Body text and metadata around 14-16px. Maintain consistent spacing – Quittr follows a 4pt grid for spacing ￼. This means use multiples of 4 pixels for margins, padding, etc. (e.g. 8px padding around cards, 16px between sections, etc.). This gives a clean, balanced look.
	•	Component Consistency: Reuse existing app components/styles wherever possible. For instance, if the app already has a card style or a button style, apply that to the new elements (category buttons, post cards, etc.). The bottom navigation bar is already present – ensure the Community icon (likely the chat bubble) is highlighted when on the community page, and similarly if Library is accessible via a menu or tab, highlight appropriately.
	•	Icons: Use the same icon set as the app for arrows, info, user, etc. The Quittr screenshots show simple, flat icons:
	•	Back arrow: a chevron pointing left.
	•	Info: a small circle with “i”.
	•	User icon: an outline of a person.
	•	Upvote arrow: a chevron up inside a circle.
	•	Chat/comment or team icons: possibly use a speech bubble for forum, and maybe a group icon for teams if needed.
	•	Plus button: a thick “+” sign.
	•	Settings (on profile page) and other icons likely use a consistent line style – match that weight and style for any new icons you introduce.
	•	Modal style: The Rules modal and any popups (like info popups or sorts) should have slightly rounded corners and maybe a semi-transparent backdrop behind. Use a color for the modal background that’s in the same family as the app (the rules modal in Quittr was a purple gradient card on top of the main screen). You can use a dark purple background for it (#3B1E5F for instance) with opacity.
	•	Buttons: The “Join Community” button in the rules modal is white with dark text – presumably to draw attention. You can use the app’s primary button style if defined; if not, doing white on dark purple as in screenshot is fine. Other buttons like the “Panic Button” (in another screenshot) are styled distinctly (red), but for our sections, main interactive buttons (like Post, Join, etc.) should be clearly visible. Perhaps use the orange or green accent if one exists, or white fill as needed.
	•	Error/Empty States: Design what happens if content is empty. For example, if no forum posts (say for a new app or if filter yields none), show a message “No posts yet. Be the first to post!” with maybe a light icon. If a user has no teams, prompt them to join/create as mentioned. These states should be styled with slightly lighter text and maybe an illustration icon (if available) but keep it minimal.
	•	Keep UI Responsive: The app might be primarily mobile (given the design), but if this Replit app is web-based, ensure the layout still looks good on different screen sizes. The grid in Learn section should wrap appropriately. Cards should maybe max-width on large screens. Use flexible units or media queries if needed. On mobile view (which is our reference), everything can be full-width.

Additional Notes and Considerations
	•	Non-Functional Requirements: Keep performance in mind – avoid doing heavy DB operations on the main thread. Use asynchronous calls to fetch data and show loading indicators. Also, ensure security for community features: sanitize user input (no script injection via posts, etc.), maybe moderate content if needed (not in scope to build moderation, but be mindful).
	•	Integration Testing: After implementing, test the flows thoroughly:
	1.	Create a few dummy articles/videos in the DB and mark them read/watched, see that percentages update.
	2.	Play a meditation audio and ensure the player works and can be exited.
	3.	Post a forum thread, then reply to it with another account if possible, check that it appears in real-time or on refresh, and counts update.
	4.	Try the community rules flow with a new user (flag false): rules should show, and only after joining can you post.
	5.	Create a team, join it with a second user, post in the team, ensure it doesn’t show in main forum if filtered, etc.
	•	Backward Compatibility: Since we must keep existing working modules untouched, make sure that adding these new pages doesn’t interfere with other navigation. E.g., if the bottom nav was not originally handling Library or Community properly, update it to point to these new pages. If the menu had a link to Library that was broken, fix it to open the new Library page. Do not remove or change other menu items (like “Articles” was separate; if you integrate it under Library, decide whether to remove the separate “Articles” button or keep it as an alternate entry that leads to the same place – just avoid duplicate content or confusion).
	•	Consistency with Quittr Logic: Follow the logic from Quittr as closely as possible. For example, Quittr might have specific ways the streak resets (the app likely updates streak daily or on relapse). Ensure nothing in the community code accidentally alters streak values – just read them. The leaderboard likely is based on current streak, not all-time best (though “Best 14 days” was shown elsewhere). Assume current streak for now.
	•	Final Touches: After building, polish the UI to match the reference. Compare spacing, font sizes, and colors with the screenshots. Small details like the red dot on the chat icon (indicating notifications) – you could implement that to show if the user has unread replies or mentions. This might be advanced, but if, say, the app tracks notifications, you can set a red dot if there are new replies to the user’s posts or new team invites. If not, you can simulate it by showing a dot whenever there are new posts since last visit (not critical, but in Quittr the red dot suggests some notification feature).
	•	Testing on Replit: Make sure to test the app in the Replit deployment (the web URL) for both Library and Community sections to verify that no errors occur (the original issue was that these pages were erroring out). Check console logs and fix any runtime errors (likely null data or undefined references if the pages were incomplete). With the above plan, each section should handle absent data gracefully (e.g. if DB returns nothing, just show “no content”).

By implementing the Library and Community pages with the above structure, we will recreate the functionality seen in Quittr’s app. The Library page will provide a rich set of resources (articles, meditations, videos, podcasts) with progress tracking for the user’s self-improvement journey. The Community page will foster user engagement via forums and teams, all while enforcing community guidelines. With careful adherence to the design and connection to the existing database, these new modules will integrate smoothly into the app and elevate the user experience to match the original Quittr app.
