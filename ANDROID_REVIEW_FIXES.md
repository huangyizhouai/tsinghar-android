# Android Review Fixes for OPPO Find X5 (Android 15)

## Blocking Issues Resolved

### 1. Launcher Icon Consistency ✓
**Issue:** Launcher icon differs from developer console upload
**Resolution:**
- Replaced all Android launcher icons with TsingHar.png from root directory
- Updated icons for all densities: mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi
- Applied to both regular and round icon variants
- Icons now consistent across launcher, developer console, and APK

**Files Updated:**
```
android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/ic_launcher.png
android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/ic_launcher_round.png
```

### 2. Consent Popup with Decline Option ✓
**Issue:** Terms agreement only offered "Agree" button, lacked "Decline" path
**Resolution:**
- Added "Decline" button to terms agreement modal
- Added "Decline" button to EULA modal
- Both buttons now present with proper styling and functionality
- Decline action closes modal and prevents app access

**Files Updated:**
```
client/src/components/terms-agreement-modal.tsx
client/src/components/eula-modal.tsx
```

### 3. Privacy Policy Date Label ✓
**Issue:** Privacy Policy omitted clearly dated "Published/Effective" label
**Resolution:**
- Added "Published/Effective Date: December 18, 2024" to privacy policy header
- Date prominently displayed in modal title section
- Complies with Android policy requirements for date transparency

**Files Updated:**
```
client/src/components/privacy-policy-modal.tsx
```

### 4. App Display Name Consistency ✓
**Issue:** App name varies between store listing, launcher, and in-app screens
**Resolution:**
- Updated to consistent "清花" naming across all platforms:
  - Android strings.xml: "清花"
  - Capacitor config: "清花"
  - Launcher display: "清花"
  - In-app title: "清花"
- No variations or inconsistencies remain

**Files Verified:**
```
android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
capacitor.config.ts
android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
```
